This value-add opportunity is centrally located within the metro Denver area in the Virginia Village submarket. It is one block from major retail including a supermarket and just one half mile from the Colorado Station light rail and bus hub. The building is located within the major Colorado and I25 employment and retail corridor and not far from the Cherry Creek shopping and office district. Major entertainment and nightlife destinations are within walking distance, especially with the Glendale Entertainment District set to be under construction soon.\n\nThe property was built as luxury apartments in ninety sixty-one with large units and balconies. Not many properties  of this vintage include two bedroom / two bath floor plans, which make up almost 50% of the building and are 1000 square feet in size. The amenities of the property include a pool and outdoor grill area, fitness room, and penthouse clubhouse. With secure access, interior hallways, and elevators, this property has the potential to achieve very strong rents after renovations. \n\nThe sellers purchased the property from the original developer in 1999.  After owning, managing, and maintaining the property on their own since then, they are ready to sell and move on. The owners run a very well maintained property, with quiet tenants, and strict rules. This property will be sold at market price with offers being due April 16th.",

While the building is currently designed as office space, the mixed-use zoning would allow the building to be converted for other healthcare related uses.",

The property, located at N3010 State Road 67, Lake Geneva, WI 53147, represents an outstanding investment opportunity due to its prime location, substantial acreage, and versatile development options. This undeveloped property rests in Lake Geneva, a popular, year-round destination for tourists and weekend visitors just 50 miles from Milwaukee and 83 miles from Chicago. The robust and well-balanced economy is established and thriving. Due to its proximity to Geneva National, the Mercyhealth Hospital and Medical Center, a busy retail corridor, sought-after residential housing, and financially flourishing business owners and neighbors, this land has a wide range of use cases with a high probability of success. Superb tourism combines with expanding residential and commercial developments to create a thriving live-work-play environment in Lake Geneva. The area offers nature-focused attractions thanks to the 21-mile Geneva Lake shoreline, and it also benefits from a local government supportive of a wide range of local businesses and industries. Aside from leisure and hospitality, Walworth County has a talented workforce in the manufacturing, health, and education sectors, creating a strong, diverse economy. The nearly 120-acre location sits at the northeast corner of the busy Highway 67 and Highway 50 intersections, boasting excellent visibility and accessibility. Furthermore, the owners are willing to consider a joint venture scenario with a developer whose vision maximizes the potential of the land.",

    "property_description": "A former coffee roasting mill, commissioned by Wm. Rohnert in 1912, 217 Broadway is a beautifully preserved relic of the great American industrial age. The tangible evidence of its productive past has been carefully curated and remains on premises adding ages of character to the gracious light filled loft space. This is truly a space like no other in Milwaukee. Inside this historic building (included in the National Register of Historic Buildings), the remnants of a building wide network of machinery are exposed to add extraordinary depth of character to contemporary uses. These cast iron machines were made specifically for coffee roasting by Josiah Burns & Sons Machine Foundry in central New York City in 1885. Interconnected between the upper two floors are three coffee roasters, coffee bean storage hoppers, cup electors, and drop chutes mechanically linking the operations between floors and setting an indelible impression for all who enter. Located in the heart of the Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee\u2019s leading creative hub, the neighborhood is home to galleries, offices in 19th century warehouses, performing arts venues like the Broadway Theater Center, and the campus of the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design. Restaurants are upscale yet approachable; sidewalk dining is popular.",

Vintage Park MOB features a covered patient drop-off, on-site management, and trail access to unwind around the campus pond. The spaces have yet to be built out, allowing for plenty of agency over the design of the medical office. Tenants can also take advantage of the expertise of Transwestern and the renowned medical property manager and owner, Welltower, to turnkey the space or provide TI allowances with creative deal structures. With the St. Luke\u2019s Hospital next door and Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, the Heart Care Center of Northwest Houston, UT Physicians at Vintage Park, a Kelsey-Seabold Clinic, and much more within three miles, this is one of the most concentrated healthcare zones in the Northwest Houston submarket. This not only provides a convenient stop for clients in need of multi-specialty care but also fosters a synergetic community of referring physicians. The locale also provides an excellent payer mix as Texas is in the top 10 of the percentage of self-paying patients in the country, and demographics indicate this submarket is above the state norm with an average household income of $108,441 within a five-mile radius. Many high-profile, affluent neighborhoods like Majestic Oaks, Estates at Windrush, and Champions, plus the upscale shopping destination Vintage Park are within five minutes of Vintage Park MOBI.",

The nine and ten-story buildings boast signage opportunities and eye-catching fa\u00e7ades with alternating bands of silver aluminum spandrels and silver reflective glass. Renovated in 2020, Loop Central features Zoly's high-quality delicatessen, a state-of-the-art conference center, a fully-equipped fitness center, and a new indoor/outdoor tenant lounge with games and dining space. Other features include efficient floor plates, concrete structures that eliminate floor vibration, building sway and inter-floor sound transmission, single-duct, variable-air-volume heating, and air-conditioning system with 12 thermostatically controlled independent air zones per floor, card key access, and 24-hour, seven days per week, on-site guard service. There is also a four-tier parking garage with 700 parking spaces (525 are covered), a landscaped courtyard with a soffit cover that connects the parking garage to the office tower, an ATM, and an Energy Management System.",

Further, the Portfolio is situated on three land parcels providing the owner the opportunity to phase-in rezoning and development. Sell Individual Buildings to Users: 6 North Park is 26% leased with the top two floors vacant (43,137 SF). Other opportunities to accommodate a user sale include consolidating leases to a single building and when the Travelers\u2019 lease expires. In short, the North Park Office Portfolio provides an investor with immediate scale in one of the strongest submarkets north of Baltimore. Investors may bid on all three buildings or individual buildings. 10 N Park Dr in Hunt Valley MD is convenient to I-695, downtown Baltimore and BWI Airport; surrounded by many fine restaurants, shops, hotels, Oregon Ridge Park, Hunt Valley Towne Centre, and desirable residential communities.",

This investment opportunity provides optionality for buyers: Operate as Office: The Portfolio is currently 63% leased with 5.0 years of WALT providing significant leasing upside for investors with a strategic plan to rebrand the park as the Hunt Valley area continues to grow. Convert to Residential: An investor can rezone a single parcel or the entire 23-acre site to residential or senior living like the Avalon Hunt Valley and Bright View Senior Living developments across the street at the Hunt Valley Towne Centre. Further, the Portfolio is situated on three land parcels providing the owner the opportunity to phase-in rezoning and development. Sell Individual Buildings to Users: 6 North Park is 26% leased with the top two floors vacant (43,137 SF). Other opportunities to accommodate a user sale include consolidating leases to a single building and when the Travelers\u2019 lease expires. In short, the North Park Office Portfolio provides an investor with immediate scale in one of the strongest submarkets north of Baltimore. Investors may bid on all three buildings or individual buildings. 4 N Park Dr in Hunt Valley MD is convenient to I-695, downtown Baltimore and BWI Airport; surrounded by many fine restaurants, shops, hotels, Oregon Ridge Park, Hunt Valley Towne Centre, and desirable residential communities.",
