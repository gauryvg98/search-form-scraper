With significant leisure business in all seasons, the Holiday Inn provides a remarkable opportunity to create a presence in a market supported by both corporate and recreational travel. The Colorado Springs market has shown strong reception to boutique and soft-branded hotels, especially downtown properties like The Mining Exchange, The Academy Hotel, Kinship Landing, and the world renowned Broadmoor. This creates an opportunity to develop a unique boutique hotel that offers an authentic Colorado experience, featuring breathtaking views of Pikes Peak and easy access to outdoor adventures.",

The hotel recently underwent a comprehensive Formula Blue renovation, securing its position with a new 10-year franchise agreement. A new owner should anticipate a light soft goods PIP as part of the change-of-ownership requirements. Due to repairs in the T12, the pool and elevator were temporarily out of service, impacting revenue. Fortunately, both facilities have since been restored and are now operational, with revenue trending towards $2.5 million in gross revenue (GRR) in 2025. The Cedar Rapids market features a diverse range of demand drivers, including manufacturing, food processing, agriculture, biotechnology, and medical technology. With the Holiday Inn Express brand being highly sought after, this acquisition represents a reliable and promising investment opportunity in the hospitality sector.",

    "property_description": "The Crags Resort presents an exceptional opportunity for the right operator to revitalize this historic early-1900s property, offering breathtaking views of Estes Park. Perched above the town at the edge of the mountains, the resort is surrounded by the granite peaks of Rocky Mountain National Park. With vistas overlooking the iconic Stanley Hotel, Lake Estes, and downtown Estes Park just a short walk away, the setting is truly unparalleled. As one of the nation\u2019s premier wedding destinations, Estes Park positions The Crags Resort as an ideal opportunity for a developer to create one of the most desirable venues in the region. Originally built in 1910, the resort features: 27 guest rooms, a spacious, open dining room, warm and inviting stone fireplaces. This historic charm makes it a perfect setting for corporate retreats from Denver, family reunions, and weddings\u2014offering unforgettable experiences in one of America\u2019s most iconic national parks. Since the early 1980s, the resort has operated as a timeshare. Now, these rooms represent fresh inventory in a supply-constrained market and are ready to welcome guests. Additionally, the recent conversion of Fall River Village into affordable housing has created an upper-upscale market gap\u2014one that The Crags Resort is uniquely positioned to fill, especially for events and group sales. Sitting on over four acres, the property offers multiple opportunities for expansion, such as: Additional guest rooms, event spaces, or parking to enhance operational value, an expanded deck for the bar, maximizing the spectacular views, a poolside pavilion or covered event space to extend the wedding and event season. The Annex Building: Currently facing structural challenges, this building could be redeveloped into a two- or three-story structure with added guest rooms and/or covered parking. Upper Parcel: Presently used for parking, this site could be reimagined to include covered parking, more guest accommodations, or event space. With the right vision and design approach, the Town of Estes Park has been supportive of developers who appreciate the area\u2019s distinctive character. This is a rare opportunity to breathe new life into a historic property while capitalizing on Estes Park\u2019s thriving tourism and event-driven economy.",

Featuring 98 rooms (+ a manager\u2019s apartment), a well-appointed water park, and an excellent location. The Dakota appeals to both transient/leisure and corporate travelers. A buyer could choose to operate it as an independent property or leverage one of the newer mid-scale brands from Hilton, IHG, and many others. Spark by Hilton has expressed interest, offering a potential opportunity to reposition the hotel under the sought after Hilton family of brands.With a history of generating $1.9 million in revenue under a previous owner, the opportunity to purchase and renovate the hotel at a value well below replacement cost presents a compelling investment strategy. This is further supported by the market\u2019s Mid-scale REVPAR of $52. In the greater Sioux Falls market, REVPAR has increased by 3.1%, reaching $78, providing additional potential for outperformance with a strong product and successful management team.",

As you may recall, the Marshall fire in 2021 tragically destroyed the Element Hotel, along with over a thousand homes and businesses. While the surrounding area has undergone significant redevelopment, this site was acquired by a developer with plans to construct a retail center. However, the city has expressed its preference for a hotel on the site. This development opportunity presents a substantial time and capital savings for a developer. Depending on the chosen brand, a buyer has the flexibility to utilize the existing footprint or even engage the previous architect to resubmit, utilizing the element brand. The site is fully entitled, with site work, impact fees, and utilities already in place. The hard and soft costs associated with the site are valued at over $2.5 million.",

Green Hills is bordered by Belle Meade to the west and Forest Hills / Brentwood to the south. The prestigious Hillsboro Road neighborhood encompasses the Mall at Green Hills and retailers such as Nordstrom, Restoration Hardware, Coach, Gucci, Apple, and Louis Vuitton. The income demographics of Green Hills are some of the best in the state. With lack of land availability, developers have begun to increase density in the Green Hills submarket, including Vertis (18 stories), Hilton (10 stories), and 3808 Cleghorn, which is currently planned for a 12-story senior living facility. The densification of Green Hills and the profile of the retailers has allowed Green Hills to be one of the fastest growing submarkets in the Southeast.",

The on-site ownership has provided for personal, hands-on maintenance of the asset and strong relationships with the building tenants evidenced by the stability and longevity of their occupancy. Four of the five tenants, including the owner, have been in place in excess of 10 years. The quality and size of the asset, along with the small number of tenants averaging just over 11,000 rsf, allows an investor to easily selfmanage the asset and maintain the family atmosphere developed by the Seller.",

Along with its new look, the Tower has been renamed to 200 East Las Olas (formerly New River Center), now taking inspiration from the renowned street it fronts. Now with a \u00b16 million dollar renovation complete, it has transformed into a level of Class A that tenants seek out above the competition. This makeover modernized the building\u2019s lobby, common areas, elevators, and exterior fa\u00e7ade, as well as added a common area conference room. The open expansive lobby is transformed with a warm sense of arrival with new lighting, stone, technology, millwork, and sleek furniture that creates a comfortable atmosphere for guests and tenants to meet and enjoy, while marble flooring in both the lobby and elevator cabs is elegant and inviting. Outside, the property is distinguished on the city\u2019s skyline by new LED up-lighting that accents the entire building from the ground up. 200 East Las Olas is proudly LEED\u00ae Platinum Certified.",

Nets are low - appx. $6/SF/YR. The location is \u201cmain-and-main\u201d in our historical Fisherman\u2019s Wharf area. Literally steps from the Cable Car turnaround, the well-known \u201cCrab Sign,\u201d tons of hotels, Boudin\u2019s Bakery (a SF legend), etc. We\u2019re in the process of delivering a restaurant shell on the ground floor with $$ to give toward a buildout. We also just leased the other half of the space to an awesome chicken concept called Pollo Campero, which is underwriting to do $4-5M/yr in sales from 155 Jefferson. So, it would offer a well-known and strong co-tenancy for you. The Landlord is a local family that can be super flexible on terms for you guys, especially while you ramp up. Once you get up and running, I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t do absolute gangbuster numbers here. Indeed, some of the restaurants in the Wharf do $5-10M/yr in sales, which is amazing. We could also potentially make the upstairs available. It\u2019s approx. 4,000 SF and currently used as the owner\u2019s office. The deal would need to make sense for the owners to move out. There\u2019s a brand new Sugar concept taking the large format restaurant next door \u2013 former Lefty O\u2019Doul\u2019s. what an amazing draw that will be for families and young people. Also, the basement of that building has been leased to an escape room game concept, which is another great draw to the immediate area. If you are interested, I can share sales figures nearby. Very impressive. Most folks are doing north of $1,000/SF in sales.",

Located directly off the River Landing exit of Interstate 526 and the last exit north of the Wando River, the property offers quick access to both Mt. Pleasant and North Charleston. The building hosts a high-quality tenant mix, with no single tenant occupying more than 15.9% of the building, ensuring a diversified base of tenants. The Charleston office market is in an expansionary phase, signaling the potential for robust growth and strong returns for investors positioned to take advantage of the slower than average capital markets\u2019 climate. Positioned as a prime value-add investment opportunity, this property is priced at a significant discount to replacement cost (>50%), presenting an exceptional opportunity for the astute investors. The combination of its attractive setting, competitive rental rates, and the high barriers to entry posed by the coastal location in the thriving Charleston market makes this property a highly compelling investment opportunity for investors with the long view in mind.",

The ideal location and amenities at 300 Welsh Road have attracted tenants such as Dish Wireless, Sofidel America, and Center for Interventional Pain & Spine. 300 Welsh Road, Buildings 1 & 2, are currently 100% occupied by six tenants, with a combined weighted average lease term of 6.86 years (not including Horsham Executive Suites), offering dependable cash flow to investors. Originally built in 1983, the Portfolio has experienced continued capital investment to maintain its best-in-class status. Within the past eight years, the seller has invested over $3.3 million in tenant fit out and over $1.23 million in base building improvements which equates to minimal capital needs going forward. Building 2 was completely renovated in 2023-2024. The Portfolio is the most visible and accessible site within the Horsham Business Center, with a combined car count of 28,000 vehicles between Welsh Road (Route 63), and Dresher Road.",

Two floors of office space sit above two floors of parking (one subterranean). Circulation is isolated and pulled away from the south face in order to maximize the light and view potential via a continuous storefront system. A translucent \u2018Kalwall\u2019 vault spans the upper footprint of the building to emit a consistent, filtered light throughout the day. A cast-in-place concrete frame becomes a \u2018brei-soleil\u2019 that fronts the street and shades east & west facing glazing. A steel shear frame, highlighted in yellow, provides a distinct character and scale for the exposed circulation components. Cross ventilation vents allow seaside breezes to flow through the office spaces. A sculpted concrete fountain introduces a continuous sound element that masks some of the street noise below.",

    "property_description": "The 61 West Medical complex presents an outstanding opportunity for a major MOB investor to establish a presence in the high barrier to entry market of Charleston, SC. This well-located West Ashley asset has an excellent mix of clinical healthcare practices and just 1.2 miles from Bon Secours/St. Francis Hospital\u2019s flagship campus. It is easily accessible from I-526 & Hwy 61, and only 7.2 miles from the central business district of historic Charleston. Boasting a growing population, a technically skilled workforce, and global marketplace connections, Charleston provides an ideal backdrop for this investment opportunity. Despite this rapid population growth the market has not seen a significant increase in new medical buildings resulting in a limited supply of quality medical space. As a result, the West Ashley submarket is currently experiencing a vacancy rate of 15% and has seen an absorption of >99,000 sf in the past 12 months (Costar report). With average rents at more than $2 psf below the sub-market average and with nearly one quarter of the existing space in the building without renewal options, this investment presents a significant value-add opportunity for the next owner. Current research also suggests a significant opportunity exists for healthcare services in the West Ashley submarket. Notably, there is a lack of facilities in primary care, physical/occupational therapy, and mental/behavioral health. Property will be sold via a call for offers process. All offers are due by 5 p.m. EST on February 28, 2025.",

    "property_description": "Sycamore Square is a prime redevelopment opportunity in northeast Memphis, strategically positioned at Sycamore View Road and Summer Avenue, with direct access to Interstate 40. This 11.72-acre site includes a 127,634-square-foot flex/office building with a potential for two outparcel sales located at 5800 Summer Avenue and 5810 Summer Avenue, offering 909 parking spaces and strong connectivity to residential and business hubs. As the long-time tenant vacates in Q3 2026, the property is ideal for adaptive reuse, redevelopment, potential building expansion, or repositioning to meet strong market demand. Its strategic infill location makes Sycamore Square an ideal candidate for industrial and last-mile distribution, with proximity to Ford's $5.6 billion Blue Oval City investment, attracting automotive suppliers, logistics operators, and e-commerce users. The northeast Memphis labor pool supports continued industrial and logistics growth. The site also presents a compelling retail redevelopment opportunity, well-suited for grocery-anchored centers, neighborhood shopping, and experiential retail concepts that align with Memphis' evolving consumer trends. Additionally, self-storage redevelopment is viable, given rising rental rates, declining vacancy, and increasing urban density. Healthcare and medical uses, such as urgent care centers, outpatient facilities, or specialty medical offices, can leverage proximity to major residential communities and transit routes for high visibility and accessibility. With its prime location, flexible zoning, and diverse redevelopment potential, Sycamore Square is poised to capture market growth across multiple asset classes, offering a premier commercial redevelopment opportunity in Memphis.",

    "property_description": "Avison Young has been engaged as exclusive agent to manage the bankruptcy auction for 1550 Bedford Avenue, a prime hotel/commercial development site in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The bankruptcy sale process provides several distinct advantages to prospective purchasers which include a streamlined, transparent acquisition process, as well as the clarity of acquiring the site with clean title. The Property is a 19,200 square foot (\u201csf\u201d) vacant lot with 192 feet of frontage along Bedford Avenue and 100 feet of frontage along Eastern Parkway. Situated in the heart of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, this site represents a rare hotel/commercial development opportunity. 1550 Bedford Ave benefits from C8-2 zoning designation, allowing for a variety of creative commercial uses. The location provides a high degree of visibility by virtue of its frontage along Eastern Parkway, a well trafficked vehicular and pedestrian throughway. The site has been approved for hotel development and is grandfathered in, providing a rare advantage in New York City due to the increasing difficulty of obtaining new special permits for hotel use. The Property is advantageously positioned in a vibrant neighborhood with growing demand for high-quality hospitality options. The Property has been fully excavated and is improved by a completed foundation which will lessen total construction costs required for either completion or a redesign of the original building plan.",

Once located at the gateway to the Long Beach Pike, the building is located in the Core of Downtown Long Beach and proximate to the Pike Outlet Shops, Waterfront, Restaurant Row and the Breakers Hotel.

The Grayson is a premier building of exceptional quality with 17,426 square feet (sf) of ground-floor retail, a state-of-the-art fitness center, a spacious outdoor terrace with grill area/fireplace/TV on the 4th floor, and a rooftop terrace with an additional grill and stunning views. The Grayson features an unparalleled location at the \u201cGateway of Old Town Alexandria\u201d along Route 1, which provides regional connectivity to Alexandria, National Landing, Arlington, and downtown DC. The Property has taken advantage of the strong third and fourth quarter demand, increasing residential occupancy from 44% in March 2024 to 92% as of January 2025. The retail portion of the Property is 100% leased to The Goddard School and Dental Inc. Construction on the Property began in November of 2021 and delivered in November of 2023. The property management team worked diligently to expedite leasing and, as of January 24, 2025, the Property has reached a blended occupancy of 93% across residential and commercial space. With increasing demand in the area and limited new supply, The Grayson is poised to capitalize on increasing rents, driving revenue higher in 2025. The Grayson represents the opportunity to acquire a best-in-class stabilized Class A Trophy multifamily property in the highest rent growth region in America. With pricing guidance below replacement cost, a comparable property may not come to market in the foreseeable future.",

On behalf of ownership, Avison Young is pleased to exclusively present the opportunity to acquire Horizon I & II at Six Forks (the \u201cProperty\u201d or \u201cHorizon\u201d), located at 7701 & 7721 Six Forks Road. Ideally positioned in one of the most coveted real estate markets in the country, and just 3.5 miles north of the vibrant North Hills mixed-use district, the Property produces stable, positive cash flow with strong, near-term upside potential. Situated on two legal parcels totaling \u00b16.7 acres, the Property consists of two, single-story office buildings totaling \u00b161,389 rentable square feet. The Property is currently 100% leased to an attractive mix of tenants with a weighted average lease term of 3+ years, and with rents 9% below market, this provides an upcoming mark-to-market opportunity. Long considered one of Raleigh\u2019s premier business corridors, rents in the Six Forks submarket are among the highest across the market and have been growing at an annualized rate of 5.7% over the last five years. With limited opportunities to acquire high-quality, single-story office product, Horizon provides an exceptional opportunity for investors to gain a foothold in the most sought-after submarket in the region at an attractive basis that is well below replacement cost.",
